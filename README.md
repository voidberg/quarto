# Quarto

> a book size of about 9½ × 12 inches (24 × 30 centimetres), determined by folding printed sheets twice to form four leaves or eight pages.

Quarto allows you to generate EPUBs from HTML.

## Introduction

Quarto was built for my [instakobo](https://github.com/voidberg/instakobo) project, where I needed a simple way to generate ePubs with the option of removing the Table of Contents.
